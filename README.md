Summary:

System Architecture: Modular, service-oriented design with separate services for Patients, Doctors, and Claims, orchestrated via a central API and supported by a scalable database.

Key Layers: Presentation (React UI), Application (business logic & AI prediction), Integration (REST APIs + AI services), Data (relational/NoSQL storage).

Data Flow: Claims flow from submission → eligibility & prior-auth checks → DB → AI prediction → workflow updates → frontend visualization → dashboard aggregation.

Phasing of Modules: Phase 1 – Core CRUD; Phase 2 – AI & analytics dashboards; Phase 3 – Full RCM workflows (eligibility, prior-auth, scrubbing, denial mgmt); Phase 4 – Advanced reconciliation, insights, payer/EMR integrations.
